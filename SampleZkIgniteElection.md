## Zk Ignite Dev 4 Dev Election

Below is a list of proposals for Zk Ignite (the list is real, but the election is fake, as a proof of concept for Mina Navigators).  As an elector, your job is to review the proposals and vote on which ones should be funded!  The voting mechanism uses custom tokens on Mina.  You will be issued a token balance of 50,000 votes, which you may split between as many of the following proposals as you like.  When you submit your vote, your tokens will be burnt, and the proposal of your choice will receive that many votes.
